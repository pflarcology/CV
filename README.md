## Rory Grieve

I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy's full-stack 12 week web development course. My interest in technology is long held and I previously worked as a reporter for two years covering startups. I am looking for a job in London with a company that's passionate about code and committed to using best practises. 

## Skills

### Attention to detail

This was an essential skill as a journalist both in my own work and when I used to edit other people's work. It's also a very important skill in programming where a typo can derail a whole app.

### Team player 
In my old job we produced a daily newsletter which required everyone to work very closely together. I helped to iumprove communicatino within the team including getting everyone to use Slack rather than Google Hangouuts. This has served me well throught my time in Maker Academy where we used pair programming every single day.
