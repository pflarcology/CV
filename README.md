## Rory Grieve

I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy's full-stack 12 week web development course. My interest in technology is long held and I previously worked as a reporter for two years covering startups. During this time I interviewed investors and entrepreneurs, reported from tech conferences and was a judge on a panel for Innovate UK evaluating a company for a government startup grant. I am looking for a job as a junior developer in London with a company that's passionate about code and committed to using best practises. 

## Skills

### Attention to detail

As a journalist attention to detail was an essential part of my job both in writing my own pieces and editing other people's work. This helps when I code, as a typo can occasionally break a whole app.

### Team player 
In my old job we produced a daily newsletter which required everyone to work very closely together. I helped to improve communication within the team including getting everyone to use Slack rather than Google Hangouts. At Makers Academy we pair programmed every day and developed projects in small teams, which strengthened my skills as a team player.
